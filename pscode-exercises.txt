// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = input number 1
b = input number 2

print a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

input n
remainder = n % 2
IF remiander is nto equal to 0.
answer = odd
else
answer = even
output answer

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5
small = n1
large = n1
for i = 2 to 5:
if n1 > ni then:
large = ni
print (Average:",avg)
print ("Smallest:", small)
print ("Largest:",large)
